Some solutions to Project Euler problems

While the two solutions provided to work, they are less than ideal examples of functional programming.

The primes code (problem 7) has an optimization in that it only checks primes as factors, and checks starting
with the smallest number, rather that simply brute force checking all possible numbers less than the
candidate.
